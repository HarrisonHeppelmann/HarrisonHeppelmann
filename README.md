### Hello Everyone!

I am a senior in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. I mostly will be using this for class projects, but also use it for sharing files for personal uses occasionally. I go to school full time and work IT on the side for the University. 

Right now my goal is to graduate and work in automated systems. One of the major steps in accomplishing this is to learn industry standard programing languages, like C. I am fairly new to the language, and hope to improve my skills with it throughout the next few months. I am already practiced with Matlab, so the biggest challenge will be in the slightly different syntax and memory allocation. 

Feel free to contact me with any questions about Matlab! I can be reached at hjhepp@iastate.edu.
